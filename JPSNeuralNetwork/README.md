# JPSNeuralNetwork
A versatile Neural Network.

## TODO
- Support for per layer activation functions (maybe per neuron, not sure if that's necessary)
- "Live" testing (e.g. User can draw a digit on screen and get a prediction.)
- Implement more cost functions
- Implement more activation functions
- Test combinations of activation functions and cost functions
