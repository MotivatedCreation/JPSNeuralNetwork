# JPSNeuralNetwork
A versatile Neural Network.

## TODO
- Implement more error functions
- Implement more activation functions
- Implement per layer/per neuron learning and momentum
- Project the weights/error surface on to a 3D surface and let the user find a local or global minima by manually selecting the gradient (E.g. Have the user selection a direction and take that as the gradient.)
- Build view controller for setting custom mapping of outputs.
